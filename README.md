This repository uses a docker compose file with a tailscale sidecar to host a funneled web application for costcodle statistics tracking via a dashboard.  Please input your CHANNEL_ID in the /app/bot.js and /app/public/index.html files.  This can be stored in your .env file.  Additionally, you will need to create a discord bot, generate a token, and add that to the .env file.
